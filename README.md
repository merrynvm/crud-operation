# write a Spring Boot application with the necessary dependencies that:
## /\ has an entity called Car with the following columns:
###### ~ an id
###### ~ a modelName
###### ~ a type

## /\ has a dedicated repository for the Car
## /\ has a dedicated controller for the Car that:
###### ~ is mapped on cars
###### ~ executes the following CRUD operations:
###### ~ create a new Car 
###### ~ return a list of all the Cars 
###### ~ return a single Car - if the id is not in the db (use existsById()), returns an empty Car
###### ~ updates the type of a specific Car, identified by id and passing a query param - if not present in the db, returns an empty Car 
###### ~ deletes a specific Car - if absent, the response will have a Conflict HTTP status
###### ~ deletes all the Cars in the db

##  /\ test the endpoints using Postman for:
###### ~ creating 2 different cars
###### ~ retrieving all the cars
###### ~ retrieving a car by the id
###### ~ trying to retrieve an absent car
###### ~ updates the type of a specific Car
###### ~ trying to update an absent car
###### ~ deleting a specific Car
###### ~ trying to delete an absent Car
###### ~ deleting all the db
